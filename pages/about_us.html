    <h1>Our History</h1>
    <img src="1600w-gW_i8TbyLrY.webp" alt="Our History Image" width="100">
    <p>We originated as a group project for an assessment at Yoobee Colleges of Creative Innovation 
        in Christchurch, New Zealand. With a passion for design and software development, we have 
        clashed out four braincells together to bring this project into the light of the general public.</p>
    <h2>Our Goals</h2>
    <img src="blog_img_06-1600x1066.jpg" alt="Our Goals Image" width="100">
    <p>Our primary goal is to bring you - yes, you reading this - a project management system 
        designed with your needs in interest. Our customisable project management system was 
        designed to be easy to adapt to and blah blah blah corporate jargon</p>
